# dragons
A work in progress extendable virtual reality game

## Unit testing
First `./gradlew shadowJar` (some plug-in tests rely on the test plug-ins being built before testing)

Then `./gradlew test`

This test will probably fail the first time because the class loader of Gradle doesn't seem to find
very new resources (the ones that should have been generated by shadowJar). If this happens, just
test again a few seconds later.
